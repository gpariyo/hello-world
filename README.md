# hello-world
The purpose of this project is to facilitate social services data visualization for low and middle income country settings

People of earth! 
We are a band of social entrepreneurs committed to using scientific knowledge and leveraging digital technology to improve the lives of people of earth everywhere, millions at a time! At this moment we are embarking on a quest to develop real time data visualization software that will turn continuously collected data, e.g., using mobile phones or other digital technology, into easy to use data dashboards. This will enable not-too-tech savvy policy and program management people in the social sector such as ministry of health officials to see at a glance the status of key population level indicators. For example, what is the current reported smoking prevalence among young adults 18-25 years old?
